    <br>
    i am a nursing major in college and one day would like to work in L&D <br>
    my interests are cheerleading, animals, being with friends and family, dinosaurs, and traveling.<br>
    my friends, family, and animals are inportant to me. my education and my cheer team are also important to me <br> 
    i have very little background playing video games but i am excited to learn. i used to play them when i was a child with my little brother <br> 
    the type of games i like are car/racing games like FORZA HORIZON. <br> 
    i am taking queer narratives in games because i think it will be fun/interesting. it also fulfills my core requirement. <br>
