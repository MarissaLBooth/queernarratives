   <h1 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">hello world! my name is Marissa!!</h1><br>
    <br>
    <span style=background-color: #9FE2BF;> My name is Marissa and I am a nursing major in college and one day would like to work in L&D.</span><br><br>
    <span style="background-color:#DFFF00">my interests are cheerleading, animals, being with friends and family, dinosaurs, horseback riding, learning new things, and traveling.</span><br><br>
    <span style="color: #26453E; background-color:#c456bd;> My friends, family, boyfriend and animals are important to me. my education and my cheer team are also important to me.</span><br><br>
     <span style="color: #013220; background-color:#dbcf2a;"> I have minimal background playing video games but am excited to learn. I used to play them as a child with my little brother and my dad. I sometimes play video games with my boyfriend's family at their house! It is so much fun!!</span><br><br> 
    <span style="color: #32012C;"> The type of games I like are car/racing games like FORZA HORIZON. I also used to like to play SIMS on my computer as a kid. I thought it was fun to create a realistic lifestyle for my people to play in.</span><br><br> 
    <span style="color:#454545; background-color: #CCCCFF;> I am taking queer narratives in games because I think it will be fun/interesting. This will be my second class at Fisher which is a queer class. this class also fulfills my core requirement.</span><br><br>
    <span style="color: green; background-color: orange;> I think queer games are a type of art that queer people use to express themselves. Queer games are also games that people who identify as queer make and play. I also thought this at the beginning of the semester and continue to think this!!</span><br>
